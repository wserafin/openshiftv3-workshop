Creating an application using .NET builder image
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this exercise we will learn how to create an application using source
code and the .NET builder image.

*Step 1: Create a project or use an existing project*

If you want to, you can create a new project based on what you have
learned in previous labs. Or you can create a new project for JBoss
Applications.

*Remember* to replace the username before running the command.

....
$ oc new-project mydotent-UserName --display-name="DotNet Applications" --description="A place for my .NET Applications"
....

*Step 2: Create an application that uses the .NET builder image*

Open the browser and select your new project *.NET  Applications*.

Click into *Browse Catalog* button.

In the search text box type `dot` and select `.NET Core Example `.

Click Next

....
In the Add to Project box select the created "My JBoss Applications" Project
Add to Project: select your project name if it is not show

Application Name: 

.NET builder : dotnet:2.0

Git Repository URL: https://github.com/wserafin/dotnet-core-2.0-example

Git Reference: master

Startup Project: .
....

image::images/dotnet-example1.png[image]
image::images/dotnet-example-2.png[image]


Click Next
Select `Create a secret in ... to be used later`
Click on *Create* and then on *Continue to the project overview*.

*Step 3: Build*

Give it some seconds and you will see OpenShift starts the build process
for you. You can view the list of builds using `oc get builds` command.

....
$ oc get builds
NAME                  TYPE      FROM          STATUS     STARTED         DURATION
dotnet-example-1      Source    Git@50ea6f4   Complete   2 minutes ago   24s
....

Note the name of the build that is running i.e. `dotnet-example-1`. We will use that
name to look at the build logs. Run the command as shown below to look
at the build logs. This will run for a few mins. At the end you will
notice that the docker image is successfully created and it will start
pushing this to OpenShift’s internal docker registry.

....
$oc get pods
NAME                   READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
dotnet-example-build   1/1       Running   0          11m

....

We can check the logs by executing the following command:

....
$ oc logs pod/dotnet-example-1-build

....


*Step 4: Deployment*

Once the image is pushed to the docker registry, OpenShift will trigger
a deploy process. Let us also quickly look at the deployment
configuration by running the following command. Note `dc` represents
`deploymentconfig`.

....
$ oc get dc dotnet-example -o json

Note where the image is picked from. It shows that the deployment picks
the image from the local registry (same ip address and port as in
buildconfig) and the image tag is the same as what we built earlier.
This means the deployment step deploys the application image what was
built earlier during the build step.

If you get the list of pods, you’ll notice that the application gets
deployed quickly and starts running in its own pod.

....
$ oc get pods

NAME                     READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
dotnet-example-1-build   0/1       Completed   0          26m
dotnet-example-1-ey7m2   1/1       Running     0          12m
....

....
$ oc get service dotnet-example

NAME                   CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                      AGE
dotnet-example        172.30.201.90   <none>        8080/TCP,8443/TCP,8778/TCP   21m
....

Route should be already created.

....
$ oc get routes

NAME      HOST/PORT                                                      PATH      SERVICES   PORT       TERMINATION
dotnet-example   dotnet-example-dotenet-user4.apps.ocpdemo.com                     dotnet-example   <all>                   None

Run the app 

http://dotnet-example-dotenet-UserName.apps.ocpdemo.com
Example for user4   http://dotnet-example-dotenet-user4.apps.ocpdemo.com

Congratulations! In this exercise you have learned how to create, build
and deploy a .NET application using OpenShift’s .NET Builder
Image.
