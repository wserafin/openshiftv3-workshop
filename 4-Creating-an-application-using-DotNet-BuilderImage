Creating an application using .NET builder image
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this exercise we will learn how to create an application using source
code and the .NET builder image.

*Step 1: Create a project or use an existing project*

If you want to, you can create a new project based on what you have
learned in previous labs. Or you can create a new project for JBoss
Applications.

*Remember* to replace the username before running the command.

....
$ oc new-project mydotent-UserName --display-name="DotNet Applications" --description="A place for my .NET Applications"
....

*Step 2: Create an application that uses the .NET builder image*

Open the browser and select your new project *.NET  Applications*.

Click into *Browse Catalog* button.

In the search text box type `dot` and select `.NET Core Example `.

Click Next

....
In the Add to Project box select the created "My JBoss Applications" Project
Add to Project: select your project name if it is not show

Application Name: 

.NET builder : dotnet:2.0

Git Repository URL: https://github.com/wserafin/dotnet-core-2.0-example

Git Reference: master

Startup Project: .
....

image::images/dotnet-example1.png[image]
image::images/dotnet-example-2.png[image]


Click Next
Select `Create a secret in ... to be used later`
Click on *Create* and then on *Continue to the project overview*.

*Step 3: Build*

Give it some seconds and you will see OpenShift starts the build process
for you. You can view the list of builds using `oc get builds` command.

....
$ oc get builds
NAME                  TYPE      FROM          STATUS     STARTED         DURATION
dotnet-example-1      Source    Git@50ea6f4   Complete   2 minutes ago   24s
....

Note the name of the build that is running i.e. `dotnet-example-1`. We will use that
name to look at the build logs. Run the command as shown below to look
at the build logs. This will run for a few mins. At the end you will
notice that the docker image is successfully created and it will start
pushing this to OpenShift’s internal docker registry.

....
$oc get pods
NAME                   READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
dotnet-example-build   1/1       Running   0          11m

....

We can check the logs by executing the following command:

....
$ oc logs pod/dotnet-example-1-build

....

Run the app 

http://dotnet-example-dotenet-UserName.apps.ocpdemo.com
Example for user4   http://dotnet-example-dotenet-user4.apps.ocpdemo.com

Congratulations! In this exercise you have learned how to create, build
and deploy a .NET application using OpenShift’s .NET Builder
Image.
